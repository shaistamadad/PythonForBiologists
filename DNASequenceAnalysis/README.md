Homework 1
N.B.
Questions
A. Sequence Analysis (5 points)
Write code in python that would execute the tasks assigned below. Remember, each question should
have associated code for answering the questions on a generic nucleic acid sequence represented as
letters A, G, C, or T. We do not want to see if you can answer the questions biologically, we want to
see if you can outline the process of answering these questions computationally. (Note: You will
need to use the standard genetic code for your solution, and assumee the first 3 nucleotides is the
beginning of the translated region/open reading frame)
sequence =
"ATGTACCACATAGTGATGGAGACGGAGCCATTGAAGCCGCCGGGCCCGCAGCAAACCTTCGGGGGGCGGCGGCGGCAAC
TCCACCGCGGCATTCGTTAG"
1. Calculate the number of nucleotides in the given sequence.
2. Check whether the sequence ends in-frame (i.e. is the length a multiple of 3?)
3. Calculate the number of codons in the given sequence (assuming it is all translated)?
4. Check whether the given sequence starts with Methionine.
5. What is the GC content of this sequence? (fraction of G and C nucleotides)
6. Write an assertion statement to check if the sequence is a valid DNA sequence
B. CMS to feet conversion (5 points)
Write a function that converts heightâ€™s in cms to feet (you should use a for statement in answering
this question):
Height_in_cms= [235, 980, 560, 420, 150]
Bonus Point (1 point)
Read about docstrings and use a docstring to document your function in part B.
